    <h1>Power BI Project: School District Analysis (2020-2021)</h1>
    <!-- Project Description Section -->

        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
            This Power BI project, covering the 2020-2021 academic year, analyzes the relationship between socio-economic factors and educational outcomes across school districts in Massachusetts, USA. The report focuses on three key areas:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Low-Income % vs. Average SAT Scores</strong>: Initially identified as a weak negative correlation, further analysis revealed a high correlation between the percentage of low-income students in a school district and lower average SAT scores, indicating that higher low-income populations are strongly associated with reduced SAT performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Median Household Income by School District</strong>: A table ranks the top 10 school districts by median household income, with Weston, MA, leading at $201,200, and Norfolk, MA, at $143,682. This highlights the economic disparity across districts.</li>
            <li><strong>Dropout Rates</strong>: The report identifies a total dropout count of 12,000 students across districts. Grade 11 leads with the highest dropout rate at 29.65% (646.1 students). The top 5 districts with the highest dropout rates are State Totals, Boston, Springfield, Brockton, and Lynn. Additional visuals provide a breakdown by grade (Grades 9â€“12) and a comparison of dropout and enrolled totals for the top 10 districts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Data was sourced from public educational datasets, cleaned using Power Query, and modeled in Power BI to create interactive visuals. The report aims to provide actionable insights for Massachusetts education policymakers to address disparities in educational outcomes.

        <h2>Conclusion and Way Forward</h2>
        <p>
            This analysis highlights significant challenges in Massachusetts school districts, particularly the high correlation between low-income populations and lower SAT scores, as well as a concerning dropout rate of 12,000 students, with Grade 11 being the most affected at 29.65%. Economic disparities are evident, with top districts like Weston having median household incomes far exceeding those in lower-ranked districts like Norfolk.
        </p>
        <p>
            To address these issues, the following steps are recommended:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Conduct further research into the causes of the high dropout rate in Grade 11 to identify specific barriers and develop targeted interventions.</li>
            <li>Provide financial support to families in lower-income district areas to alleviate economic pressures that may contribute to lower academic performance and higher dropout rates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            By implementing these measures, Massachusetts education policymakers can work towards reducing educational disparities and improving outcomes for all students.
